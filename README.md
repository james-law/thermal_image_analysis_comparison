Analysis of results of using a manual and novel semi-automated method to analysis thermal images of supraclavicular brown adipose tissue

Thermal imaging is increasingly used to detect changes in supraclavicular skin temperature associated with underlying brown adipose tissue activity. We have developed a semi-automated method to analyse thermal images (Law, James, et al. "Thermal imaging is a noninvasive alternative to PET/CT for measurement of brown adipose tissue activity in humans." Journal of Nuclear Medicine 59.3 (2018): 516-522.  DOI: https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.117.190546).

We compared the efficiency (accuracy and speed) of using the manual method (Symonds, Michael E., et al. "Thermal imaging to assess age-related changes of skin temperature within the supraclavicular region co-locating with brown adipose tissue in healthy children." The Journal of pediatrics 161.5 (2012): 892-898. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2012.04.056) with the semi-automated method.

This repository contains the code used to analyse the outputs from both methods and compare them.
